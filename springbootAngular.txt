From within visual studio code type cntrl-shift-P

Select the language (Java most likely)
Enter a group id (something unique ... usually your intended url backwards).
Enter an artifact id (name of the project) Must start with lowercase letter ... generated directory with this name
  which pisses me off as I like to have my directory names be capitolized.

select dependencies (web, db, etc) ... Spring web, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver, Spring Boot DevTools
hit enter and select where it will create the project.
